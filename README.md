# A Dog Tale

The is the source code for a game demo I wrote for the Net Yaroze in 1997, called A Dog Tale. Demo being the key word here. In fact the whole thing only started because I wanted to write some code to do [parallax scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling), and it kind of grew from there. 

Before I knew it Sony were looking for examples of Net Yaroze games to promote the platform and so I submitted it. But let's be clear upfront, it's a terrible game. It's not even a game really, it's just a demo of some ideas I was playing around with. But it's a great example of how old code never dies.

You may know the game as it was subsequently published on the cover CD of the Official UK Playstation Magazine (Issue 28), as well as various other magazines and Sony promotional disks for the Net Yaroze programme.

[The Net Yaroze was a development kit for the original Playstation](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-yaroze-sonys-first-indie-push), released by Sony in 1997. It was a black Playstation with a different boot ROM, and a Sony SDK. It was only available to hobbyists and small developers, and cost £750. It was a way to write games for dedicated hardware that didn't exist outside of the more expensive blue professional developer kits. It was their attempt to inject some indie spirit into the Playstation, and console gaming generally and was pretty successful at that.

The thing is mostly this code was written late at night, often after I'd had a few cans of cider (I coined the ficticious company name 'CiderLogic' in my head at the time), and it was also written as I was just starting out a career in software engineering. So to say it's not the best written or structured code in the world is something of an understatement. But I've left it as it was written at the time, because it's important to know when enough is enough.

Is it a good game? No, it's absolutely terrible. The jumping is devoid of any kind of gravity, and it's far too easy to die. I thought I was being clever making it so tricky, but apparantly that just makes a game hard to play and frustrating.

But it is a great example of how old code never dies. Through the love of retro gaming and the power of emulation, people are still playing it and commenting on it, which I find hilarious. Even up until quite recently I was still getting contacted by people who had played it back in the day, and wanted to know more about it.

For some reason over the years people have taken to recording videos of themselves playing it and putting them on YouTube. There are dozens of them, which to be honest I find a little weird for something I didn't spend much time on. Here's one example:

Back in 2015 [somebody even wrote an article about it](https://killscreen.com/previously/articles/dog-tale-or-death-mystery/) which was something of a surprise. So I thought I'd put it up on GitHub for anyone who wants to take a look at what's going on behind the curtain.

Should I feel embarassed by the quality of the coding and how bad the game is? No not at all. It's a fair reflection of my abilities at the time, and importantly it was good enough to do what I wanted to achieve. I guess if you wanted to be reminicent about it, you could say it's a snapshot of an era when I was just starting out on my career, and I was still learning. But of course the role of a software engineer is to always be learning, so I guess not much has changed.

To me it's kind of a time capsule. You can sense the joy and hope in the original project readme.txt:

```
This was my first finished game, and very proud of it I am too!

This version is slightly different from the first release as I have made it slightly easier and fixed a couple of small bugs, after some friendly advice from a few individuals.

I hadn't planned to work on this game anymore, after I finished it, but I did a bit of work with it so SCEE could put it on the demo CD for the Official Playstation Magazine (Issue 28), so I thought I'd re- release this version to everybody else too, together with the source code.

The source code is a bit messy, and by no means optimised, I just wrote it off the cuff as I went along and it all just worked so I never changed anything. There are some good bits and some bits I will be changing in newer games, but this will stay as is.

Feel free to use parts of the source code for whatever you want, all I ask is that you mail me to let me know, and put a thank you in your program if you can.

Even better is the scrolling message (which isn't available in all versions of the game as Sony wanted me to remove it for some reason) that I remember writing as a last thought as I needed to go to bed:

I was twenty-seven at the time I wrote that, already looking back fondly to my time as a seventeen year-old spotty bedroom coder. At the time of writing this I am now fifty-three years-old. Time really does fly.

Anyway, the point to all of this - if there is one at all - is that the code you write today is likely to be around much longer than you think it will be. But don't overthink it or worry about it. Code to the best of your ability today and don't look back. Perfection is the enemy of good enough.
