A Dog Tale

This was my first finished game, and very proud of it I am too!

This version is slightly different from the first release as I have made it slightly easier and fixed a couple of small bugs, after some friendly advice from a few individuals.

I hadn't planned to work on this game anymore, after I finished it, but I did a bit of work with it so SCEE could put it on the demo CD for the Official Playstation Magazine (Issue 28), so I thought I'd re- release this version to everybody else too, together with the source code.

The source code is a bit messy, and by no means optimised, I just wrote it off the cuff as I went along and it all just worked so I never changed anything. There are some good bits and some bits I will be changing in newer games, but this will stay as is.

Feel free to use parts of the source code for whatever you want, all I ask is that you mail me to let me know, and put a thank you in your program if you can.
